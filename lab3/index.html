					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to create a local
				file structure on my computer and add index.html files. </p>

					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>It was straight forward with the instructions and task.
					I had it difficult syncing Visual Studio Code to GitHub and worked on ot for 5 hours and
					turns out I just remade and reerased 5 times. And now I have ART101J as my Repo name. </p>
